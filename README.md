# Learn React from the freecodecamp youtube.

This repo was made by me when i was trying to learn react with the tutorial 
provided freecodecamp on youtube. 

The link for the tutorial is given here - https://youtu.be/DLX62G4lc44

This is just for learning purpose and also if i ever wanted to look back 
about the journey that i had to take while learning React. While i am 
comfy with Javascript i am not much well versed with all the JS versions
and you will find random JS code written according to my level of JS 
understanding.
